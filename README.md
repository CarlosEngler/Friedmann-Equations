Developed together with @JPBF100

This is the project for the discipline MAP3122 at USP. This project consists in the implementation of numerical methods (Runge-Kutta and cubic splines) for simulating an Einstein de Sitter universe, in the context of the Friedmann equations (that are a particular solution for the einstein field equations)

The details and implications of the Einstein De Sitter universe, as well as an explanation for the numerical methods utilized, can be found in the PDF included in the repository.
